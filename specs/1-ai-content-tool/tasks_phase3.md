**Feature**: 1-ai-content-tool | **Date**: 2026-01-13 | **Plan**: [link to plan.md](./plan.md)

**Note**: This file is generated by `/sp.tasks` command from feature specification and implementation plan.

## Summary

Phase 3 implementation focuses on advanced features including Research Assistance (P3) and Export & Workflow Management (P3) as outlined in the original specification. This phase will add research capabilities to gather relevant data and references, export functionality for various platforms (blogs, social media, ad campaigns), and workflow orchestration for managing complex multi-step content processes.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Content Generation) must be completed
- User Story 2 (SEO Optimization) must be completed
- User Story 3 (Quality Review) must be completed
- User Story 4 (Ethics Safeguards) must be completed

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Research service and export service can be developed in parallel
- Research API routes and export API routes can be developed in parallel
- Individual platform export modules can be developed in parallel

## Phase 1: Setup Tasks

**Goal**: Initialize project structure and dependencies for Phase 3 features

- [ ] T001 Set up project dependencies for research and export features (google-search-results, platform APIs)
- [ ] T002 Configure Redis connection for caching research results and workflow state
- [ ] T003 Add platform API keys to environment configuration (Twitter, Facebook, WordPress, etc.)
- [ ] T004 Create initial directory structure for new models, services, and routes

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

**Goal**: Establish foundational components that support both user stories

- [ ] T005 [P] Create workflow helper utilities in src/utils/workflow_helpers.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Define shared data structures for workflow management in src/models/workflow.py
- [ ] T007 Update settings configuration to include research and export settings in src/config/settings.py

## Phase 3: User Story 5 - Research Assistance (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: User provides search queries and target domains to gather relevant data, references, or examples that support content creation. The system delivers focused and goal-specific information retrieval.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing research queries and receiving structured research results that support content creation.

- [ ] T008 [US5] Create ResearchResult model in src/models/research_result.py
- [ ] T009 [P] [US5] Create Research Assistance service in src/services/research_assistance.py
- [ ] T010 [P] [US5] Implement Google SERP integration in src/services/research_assistance.py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US5] Implement source credibility assessment in src/services/research_assistance.py
- [ ] T012 [P] [US5] Create research API routes in src/api/routes/research.py
- [ ] T013 [US5] Add research endpoint to main API router in src/api/main.py
- [ ] T014 [US5] Implement research request validation in src/services/validation.py
- [ ] T015 [US5] Add caching mechanism for research results using Redis

## Phase 4: User Story 6 - Export & Workflow Management (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: User exports content for blogs, social media, ad campaigns, or marketing platforms. The system manages subagent workflows with one-task → one-completion execution model and orchestrates subagent execution and integrates outputs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by exporting content in various formats and verifying successful integration with target platforms.

- [ ] T016 [US6] Create ExportPackage model in src/models/export_package.py
- [ ] T017 [P] [US6] Create Export Management service in src/services/export_management.py
- [ ] T018 [P] [US6] Implement blog platform export (WordPress, Medium) in src/services/export_management.py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US6] Implement social media export (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) in src/services/export_management.py
- [ ] T020 [P] [US6] Implement ad campaign export (Google Ads, Facebook Ads) in src/services/export_management.py
- [ ] T021 [P] [US6] Create export API routes in src/api/routes/export.py
- [ ] T022 [US6] Add export endpoint to main API router in src/api/main.py
- [ ] T023 [P] [US6] Create Workflow Orchestration service in src/services/workflow_orchestration.py
- [ ] T024 [P] [US6] Implement workflow state management with Redis in src/services/workflow_orchestration.py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US6] Create workflow API routes in src/api/routes/workflow.py
- [ ] T026 [US6] Add workflow endpoint to main API router in src/api/main.py
- [ ] T027 [US6] Implement export format validation and conversion
- [ ] T028 [US6] Add platform-specific content adaptation logic
- [ ] T029 [US6] Implement workflow status tracking and monitoring
- [ ] T030 [US6] Add error handling and retry mechanisms for export operations

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing

**Goal**: Integrate research and export features with existing system and implement comprehensive testing

- [ ] T031 [P] Create integration tests for research functionality
- [ ] T032 [P] Create integration tests for export functionality
- [ ] T033 [P] Create integration tests for workflow orchestration
- [ ] T034 [P] Implement end-to-end tests for combined research and export workflows
- [ ] T035 Update documentation with new API endpoints and usage examples
- [ ] T036 Create usage examples for research and export features
- [ ] T037 Add logging and monitoring for new services

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Goal**: Final touches and cross-cutting concerns for production readiness

- [ ] T038 [P] Add comprehensive error handling to all new API endpoints
- [ ] T039 [P] Implement rate limiting for external API calls (research, export platforms)
- [ ] T040 [P] Add security validation for platform API integrations
- [ ] T041 [P] Implement proper data sanitization for export content
- [ ] T042 [P] Add audit logging for research queries and export operations
- [ ] T043 [P] Optimize caching strategies for research results and workflow states
- [ ] T044 Update API documentation with new endpoints and schemas
- [ ] T045 Conduct security review of platform API integrations
- [ ] T046 Performance testing for research queries and export operations
- [ ] T047 Update quickstart guide with Phase 3 features

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Start with basic research functionality and a single export platform (e.g., WordPress blog export) to validate the core concepts.

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. Basic research functionality with Google SERP integration
2. Single export platform (WordPress)
3. Additional export platforms (social media)
4. Workflow orchestration capabilities
5. Additional research features (source credibility, advanced filtering)

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can initiate research queries and receive structured results within 10 seconds
- Users can export content to at least one platform with 95% formatting accuracy
- Workflow management provides real-time status updates for multi-step processes
- All features maintain the ethical standards and user control principles defined in the constitution
