**Analytics & Insights Features**: Adding content performance tracking, SEO effectiveness measurement, engagement analytics, and actionable insights generation.

- Complete technical context covering language, dependencies (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, PostgreSQL), storage, testing, and performance goals
- Constitution check ensuring all principles are maintained, especially privacy and user control
