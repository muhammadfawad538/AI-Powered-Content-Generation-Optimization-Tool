# Prompt History Record

## Command
```
sp.plan plan for phase 3
```

## Original Prompt
```
plan for phase 3
```

## Response Summary
Created comprehensive implementation plan for Phase 3 of the AI-Powered Content Generation & Optimization Tool. Phase 3 focuses on:

1. **Research Assistance (P3)**: Adding research capabilities to gather relevant data and references from specified domains
2. **Export & Workflow Management (P3)**: Adding export functionality for various platforms (blogs, social media, ad campaigns) and workflow orchestration for managing complex multi-step content processes

The plan includes:
- Complete technical context covering language, dependencies, storage, testing, and performance goals
- Constitution check ensuring all principles are maintained
- Detailed project structure showing new models, services, API routes, and utilities to be created
- Complexity tracking for justified architectural decisions

This completes the comprehensive content creation lifecycle from initial generation (Phase 1) to optimization (Phase 2) to research and export (Phase 3).

## Outcome
Successfully created Phase 3 implementation plan that extends the existing architecture while maintaining consistency with previous phases and adhering to project constitution principles.
