# Prompt History Record

## Command
```
sp.tasks tasks for phase 3
```

## Original Prompt
```
 tasks for phase 3
```

## Response Summary
Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Phase 3 of the AI-Powered Content Generation & Optimization Tool. The tasks are organized in phases:

1. **Setup Tasks**: Initialize dependencies and structure
2. **Foundational Tasks**: Core utilities and data models
3. **User Story 5 (Research Assistance)**: Research query and data gathering functionality
4. **User Story 6 (Export & Workflow Management)**: Platform export and workflow orchestration
5. **Integration & Testing**: Cross-feature integration and testing
6. **Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Production readiness

The 47 tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. They cover:
- ResearchResult and ExportPackage models
- Research Assistance and Export Management services
- API routes for research, export, and workflow
- Platform integrations (WordPress, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Workflow orchestration capabilities
- Caching and performance optimizations

## Outcome
Successfully created detailed task list for Phase 3 implementation that extends the existing architecture while maintaining consistency with previous phases and enabling parallel development.
